# GTSC / Nameof

The methods in this package are used to convert TypeScript class/type/property names to embedded strings, so that they are available to your JavaScript code at runtime.

This package is used in conjunction with the `@gtsc/nameof-transformer` package, without using the transformer for compilation you will end up with an error string embedded in your code instead of the runtime name you are expecting.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @gtsc/nameof
```

## Examples

Usage of the APIs is shown in the examples [docs/examples.md](docs/examples.md)

## Reference

Detailed reference documentation for the API can be found in [docs/reference/modules.md](docs/reference/modules.md)

## Changelog
